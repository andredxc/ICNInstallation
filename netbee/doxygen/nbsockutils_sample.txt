/** \example sockutilstest.cpp

<hr>
This program can be used to see how to use the <code>nbsockutils</code> cross-platform socket class. It creates a TCP connection (either IPv4 or IPv6) and it exchanges some data on it.

This program should be launched twice, one time in 'server' mode and one in client mode. Once this has been done, the client will send a string (typed by the user) to the server, which will show the string on screen.
