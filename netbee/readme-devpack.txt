  the pre-compiled samples, plus all the NetBee-based tools (such a nbeedump).
  In addition, it includes also some NetPDL files, some with a few protocols,
  other with a more complete set of protocols.

- 'include' folder: all the header files required to create a program based on 
  NetBee. For most of the programs, you can just include "nbee.h", which will 
  include all the remaining headers. If you wanto to link agains some specific 
  module of NetBee, you have to choise the right header file.

- 'lib' folder: all the libraries, which are required to link your program with 
  NetBee.
