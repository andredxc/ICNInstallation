jNDN:  A Named Data Networking client library for Java
======================================================

Prerequisites
=============

* Required: Java JDK version >= 1.7
* Required: Apache Maven (for building the jar file and running unit tests)
* Optional: Android SDK (for Android examples)
* Optional: sqlite-jdbc (for key storage). This is installed by Maven.
* Optional: Protobuf (for the ProtobufTlv converter and ChronoSync). This is
  installed by Maven.

Following are the detailed steps for each platform to install the prerequisites.

## OS X 10.9.5, OS X 10.10.2, OS X 10.11, macOS 10.12 and macOS 10.13
To install Apache Maven, first install Xcode. To install the command line tools, in a terminal enter:

    xcode-select --install

Install Brew from https://brew.sh

In a terminal, enter:

    brew install maven

Optional: To install Android SDK, install from https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html .

## Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 15.04, 16.04 and 18.04
To install Apache Maven, in a terminal enter:

    sudo apt-get install maven

## Windows
jNDN is tested on Windows 7 64-bit.

To install Apache Maven, follow the instructions at http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi .
Also see the Windows install hints at
http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html .

Build
=====

To build in a terminal, change directory to the jNDN root.  Enter:

    mvn package

This builds the default profile "with-protobuf" which puts jndn-<version>.jar in
the 'target' folder. The jar file includes ProtobufTlv and other classes so that
your deployed application needs the Google Protobuf library. To build without
this dependency, enter the following which puts jndn-without-protobuf-<version>.jar
in the 'target' folder:

    mvn -f pom-without-protobuf.xml package

Building 'package' automatically runs the unit tests in the folder 'tests'. To also
run the integration tests (you must be running NFD), in a terminal enter:

    mvn test -P with-integration-tests

To run the examples, you must first install the jar file. In the jNDN root directory, enter:

    mvn install

To run an example such as TestEncodeDecodeFibEntry (see the list below), make sure the jar file
is installed (see above). Change to the 'examples' directory. In a terminal enter:

    mvn -q test -DclassName=TestEncodeDecodeFibEntry

To make documentation, in a terminal change directory to the jNDN root and enter:

    mvn javadoc:javadoc -P javadoc

The documentation output is in `target/site/apidocs`.

To run the Android samples, install the Android SDK as shown above. The samples
were tested by installing the following in the Android SDK Manager:
"Android SDK Build tools rev 21.1", all support for Android 5.0 (API 21),
"Extras / Android Support Repository" and "Extras / Android Support Library".
Also, in the Android Virtual Device Manager create an Android 5.0 device. Also,
import adt-bundle/sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat into the workspace.

* samples/android/NDNPing: Ping an NDN testbed server and show the ping time.  To build, in Eclipse you need to right-click on src/net and fix the link to the jndn/src/net folder.

Files
=====
This makes the following library:

* target/jndn-<version>.jar: The jNDN library.

When you run `mvn test` in the examples directory, it compiles the following java classes
from examples/src/net/named_data/jndn/tests and puts the class files in
examples/target/classes/net/named_data/jndn/tests:

* TestGetAsync: Connect to one of the NDN testbed hubs, express an interest and display the received data.
* TestPublishAsyncNfd: Connect to the local NFD hub, accept interests with prefix /testecho and echo back a data packet. See test-echo-consumer.
* TestEchoConsumer: Prompt for a word, send the interest /testecho/word to the local hub which is echoed by test-publish-async-nfd.
* TestEncodeDecodeInterest: Encode and decode an interest, testing interest selectors and the name URI.
* TestEncodeDecodeData: Encode and decode a data packet, including signing the data packet.
* TestEncodeDecodeFibEntry: Encode and decode a sample Protobuf message using ProtobufTlv.
* TestChronoChat: A command-line chat application using the ChronoSync2013 API, compatible with ChronoChat-js.

Running `mvn javadoc:javadoc` puts code documentation in target/site/apidocs.
