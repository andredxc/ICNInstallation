/**
 * SegmentFetcher is a utility class to the fetch latest version of segmented data.
 *
 * SegmentFetcher assumes that the data is named /<prefix>/<version>/<segment>,
 * where:
 * - <prefix> is the specified name prefix,
 * - <version> is an unknown version that needs to be discovered, and
 * - <segment> is a segment number. (The number of segments is unknown and is
 *   controlled by the `FinalBlockId` field in at least the last Data packet.
 *
 * The following logic is implemented in SegmentFetcher:
 *
 * 1. Express the first Interest to discover the version:
 *
 *    >> Interest: /<prefix>?ChildSelector=1&MustBeFresh=true
 *
 * 2. Infer the latest version of the Data: <version> = Data.getName().get(-2)
 *
 * 3. If the segment number in the retrieved packet == 0, go to step 5.
 *
 * 4. Send an Interest for segment 0:
 *
 *    >> Interest: /<prefix>/<version>/<segment=0>
 *
 * 5. Keep sending Interests for the next segment while the retrieved Data does
 *    not have a FinalBlockId or the FinalBlockId != Data.getName().get(-1).
 *
 *    >> Interest: /<prefix>/<version>/<segment=(N+1))>
 *
 * 6. Call the OnComplete callback with a blob that concatenates the content
 *    from all the segmented objects.
 *
 * If an error occurs during the fetching process, the OnError callback is called
 * with a proper error code.  The following errors are possible:
 *
 * - `INTEREST_TIMEOUT`: if any of the Interests times out
 * - `DATA_HAS_NO_SEGMENT`: if any of the retrieved Data packets don't have a segment
 *   as the last component of the name (not counting the implicit digest)
 * - `SEGMENT_VERIFICATION_FAILED`: if any retrieved segment fails
 *   the user-provided VerifySegment callback or KeyChain verifyData.
 *
 * In order to validate individual segments, a KeyChain needs to be supplied.
 * If verifyData fails, the fetching process is aborted with
 * SEGMENT_VERIFICATION_FAILED. If data validation is not required, pass a null
 * KeyChain.
 *
 * Example:
 *     void onComplete(const Blob& encodedMessage);
 *
 *     void onError(SegmentFetcher::ErrorCode errorCode, const string& message);
 *
 *     Interest interest(Name("/data/prefix"));
 *     interest.setInterestLifetimeMilliseconds(1000);
 *
 *     SegmentFetcher.fetch(face, interest, 0, onComplete, onError);
