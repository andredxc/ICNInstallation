/**
 * The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) stores the private portion of a user's
 * cryptography keys. The format and location of stored information is indicated
 * by the TPM locator. The TPM is designed to work with a PIB (Public
 * Information Base) which stores public keys and related information such as
 * certificates.
 *
 * The TPM also provides functionalities of cryptographic transformation, such
 * as signing and decryption.
 *
 * A TPM consists of a unified front-end interface and a backend implementation.
 * The front-end caches the handles of private keys which are provided by the
 * backend implementation.
 *
 * Note: A Tpm instance is created and managed only by the KeyChain. It is
 * returned by the KeyChain getTpm() method, through which it is possible to
 * check for the existence of private keys, get public keys for the private
 * keys, sign, and decrypt the supplied buffers using managed private keys.
