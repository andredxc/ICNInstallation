/**
 * In general, a PIB (Public Information Base) stores the public portion of a
 * user's cryptography keys. The format and location of stored information is
 * indicated by the PIB locator. A PIB is designed to work with a TPM (Trusted
 * Platform Module) which stores private keys. There is a one-to-one association
 * between a PIB and a TPM, and therefore the TPM locator is recorded by the PIB
 * to enforce this association and prevent one from operating on mismatched PIB
 * and TPM.
 *
 * Information in the PIB is organized in a hierarchy of
 * Identity-Key-Certificate. At the top level, this Pib class provides access to
 * identities, and allows setting a default identity. Properties of an identity
 * (such as PibKey objects) can be accessed after obtaining a PibIdentity object.
 * (Likewise, CertificateV2 objects can be obtained from a PibKey object.)
 *
 * Note: A Pib instance is created and managed only by the KeyChain, and is
 * returned by the KeyChain getPib() method.
