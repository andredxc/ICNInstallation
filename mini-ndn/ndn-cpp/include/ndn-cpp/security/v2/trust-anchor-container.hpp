 * A TrustAnchorContainer represents a container for trust anchors.

 * There are two kinds of anchors: 
 * static anchors that are permanent for the lifetime of the container, and
 * dynamic anchors that are periodically updated.
 *
 * Trust anchors are organized in groups. Each group has a unique group id. 
 * The same anchor certificate (same name without considering the implicit
 * digest) can be inserted into multiple groups, but no more than once into each.
 *
 * Dynamic groups are created using the appropriate TrustAnchorContainer.insert
 * method. Once created, the dynamic anchor group cannot be updated.
 *
 * The returned pointer to Certificate from `find` methods is only guaranteed to 
 * be valid until the next invocation of `find` and may be invalidated
 * afterwards.
