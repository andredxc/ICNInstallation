This module defines the PibKey class which provides access to a key at the
second level in the PIB's Identity-Key-Certificate hierarchy. A PibKey object
has a Name (identity + "KEY" + keyId), and contains one or more CertificateV2
objects, one of which is set as the default certificate of this key. A
certificate can be directly accessed by getting a CertificateV2 object.
