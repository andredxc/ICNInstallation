This module defines the SelfVerifyPolicyManager class which implements a
PolicyManager to look in the storage for the public key with the name in
the KeyLocator (if available) and use it to verify the data packet or signed
interest, without searching a certificate chain. If the public key can't be
found, the verification fails.
