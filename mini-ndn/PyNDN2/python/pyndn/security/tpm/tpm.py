"""
The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) stores the private portion of a user's
cryptography keys. The format and location of stored information is indicated by
the TPM locator. The TPM is designed to work with a PIB (Public Information
Base) which stores public keys and related information such as certificates.

The TPM also provides functionalities of cryptographic transformation, such as
signing and decryption.

A TPM consists of a unified front-end interface and a backend implementation.
The front-end caches the handles of private keys which are provided by the
backend implementation.

Note: A Tpm instance is created and managed only by the KeyChain. It is returned
by the KeyChain getTpm() method, through which it is possible to check for the
existence of private keys, get public keys for the private keys, sign, and
decrypt the supplied buffers using managed private keys.
