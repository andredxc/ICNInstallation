"""
This module defines the ValidationState class which is an abstract base class
for DataValidationState and InterestValidationState.

One instance of the validation state is kept for the validation of the whole
certificate chain.

The state collects the certificate chain that adheres to the selected validation
policy to validate data or interest packets. Certificate, data, and interest
packet signatures are verified only after the validator determines that the
chain terminates with a trusted certificate (a trusted anchor or a previously
validated certificate). This model allows filtering out invalid certificate
chains without incurring (costly) cryptographic signature verification overhead
and mitigates some forms of denial-of-service attacks.

A validation policy and/or key fetcher may add custom information associated
with the validation state using tags.
