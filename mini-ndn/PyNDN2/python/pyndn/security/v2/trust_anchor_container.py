"""
This module defines the TrustAnchorContainer class which represents a container
for trust anchors.

There are two kinds of anchors:
static anchors that are permanent for the lifetime of the container, and
dynamic anchors that are periodically updated.

Trust anchors are organized in groups. Each group has a unique group id.
The same anchor certificate (same name without considering the implicit
digest) can be inserted into multiple groups, but no more than once into each.

Dynamic groups are created using the appropriate TrustAnchorContainer.insert
method. Once created, the dynamic anchor group cannot be updated.

The returned pointer to Certificate from `find` methods is only guaranteed to
be valid until the next invocation of `find` and may be invalidated
afterwards.
