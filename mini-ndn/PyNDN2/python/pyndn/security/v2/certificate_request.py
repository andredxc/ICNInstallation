This module defines the CertificateRequest class which represents a request for
a certificate, associated with the number of retries left. The _interest and
_nRetriesLeft fields are public so that you can modify them. _interest is the
Interest for the requested Data packet or Certificate, and _nRetriesLeft is the
number of remaining retries after a timeout or NACK.
