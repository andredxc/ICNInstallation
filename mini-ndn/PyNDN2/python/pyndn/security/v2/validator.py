"""
This module defines the Validator class which provides an interface for
validating data and interest packets.

Every time a validation process is initiated, it creates a ValidationState that
exists until the validation finishes with either success or failure. This state
serves several purposes:
to record the Interest or Data packet being validated,
to record the failure callback,
to record certificates in the certification chain for the Interest or Data
packet being validated,
to record the names of the requested certificates in order to detect loops in
the certificate chain,
and to keep track of the validation chain size (also known as the validation
"depth").

During validation, the policy and/or key fetcher can augment the validation
state with policy- and fetcher-specific information using tags.

A Validator has a trust anchor cache to save static and dynamic trust anchors, a
verified certificate cache for saving certificates that are already verified,
and an unverified certificate cache for saving pre-fetched but not yet verified
certificates.
