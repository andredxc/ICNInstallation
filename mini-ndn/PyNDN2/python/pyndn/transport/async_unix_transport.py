This module defines the AsyncUnixTransport class which extends
AsyncSocketTransport for async communication over a Unix socket using Python's
asyncio. This only uses asyncio for communication. To make this thread-safe, you
must dispatch calls to send(), etc. to the asyncio loop using, e.g.,
call_soon_threadsafe, as is done by ThreadsafeFace. To use this, you do not need
to call processEvents.
