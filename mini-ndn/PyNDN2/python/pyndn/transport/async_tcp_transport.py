This module defines the AsyncTcpTransport class which extends
AsyncSocketTransport for async communication over TCP using Python's asyncio.
This only uses asyncio for communication. To make this thread-safe, you must
dispatch calls to send(), etc. to the asyncio loop using, e.g.,
call_soon_threadsafe, as is done by ThreadsafeFace. To use this, you do not need
to call processEvents.
