This module defines the GroupManagerDb class which is an abstract base class for
the storage of data used by the GroupManager. It contains two tables to store
Schedules and Members. This is an abstract base class. A subclass must implement
the methods. For example, see Sqlite3GroupManagerDb.
Note: This class is an experimental feature. The API may change.
