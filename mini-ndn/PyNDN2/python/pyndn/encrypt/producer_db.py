This module defines the ProducerDb class which is an abstract base class for the
storage of keys for the producer. It contains one table that maps time slots (to
the nearest hour) to the content key created for that time slot. A subclass must
implement the methods. For example, see Sqlite3ProducerDb.
Note: This class is an experimental feature. The API may change.
