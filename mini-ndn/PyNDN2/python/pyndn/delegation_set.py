This module defines the DelegationSet class which holds a list of
DelegationSet.Delegation entries which is used as the content of a Link instance.
If you add elements with add(), then the list is a set sorted by preference
number then by name. But wireDecode will add the elements from the wire
encoding, preserving the given order and possible duplicates (in which case a
DelegationSet really holds a "list" and not necessarily a "set").
