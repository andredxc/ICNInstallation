        Send the Interest through the transport, read the entire response and
        call onData, onTimeout or onNetworkNack as described below.
        There are two forms of expressInterest.
        The first form takes the exact interest (including lifetime):
        expressInterest(interest, onData [, onTimeout] [, onNetworkNack] [, wireFormat]).
        The second form creates the interest from a name and optional
        interest template:
        expressInterest(name [, interestTemplate], onData [, onTimeout]
        [, onNetworkNack] [, wireFormat]).

        :param Interest interest: The Interest (if the first form is used). This

          selectors from the template (if the second form is used).  If omitted,
          use a default interest lifetime.
        :param onData: When a matching data packet is received, this calls
          onData(interest, data) where interest is the interest given to
          expressInterest and data is the received Data object. NOTE: You must
          not change the interest object - if you need to change it then make a
          copy.
          NOTE: The library will log any exceptions raised by this callback, but
          for better error handling the callback should catch and properly
          handle any exceptions.

          or omitted, this does not use it.

          handle any exceptions.

          interest is received and onNetworkNack is not None, this calls
          onNetworkNack(interest, networkNack) and does not call onTimeout.
          interest is the sent Interest and networkNack is the received
          NetworkNack. If onNetworkNack is supplied, then onTimeout must be
          supplied too. However, if a network Nack is received and onNetworkNack
          is None, do nothing and wait for the interest to time out. (Therefore,
          an application which does not yet process a network Nack reason treats
          a Nack the same as a timeout.)

        the pending interest table).
