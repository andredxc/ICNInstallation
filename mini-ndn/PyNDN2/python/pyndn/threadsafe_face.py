    """
    Create a new ThreadsafeFace to use the asyncio loop to process events and
    schedule communication calls. You must start the loop on the thread in which
    you want the library to call communication callbacks such as onData and
    onInterest.
    In Python <= 3.2, you must have the prerequisite Trollius library. See the
    INSTALL file for installation details. For usage, see the example
    test_get_async_threadsafe.py.
    This constructor has the forms ThreadsafeFace(loop),
    ThreadsafeFace(loop, transport, connectionInfo) or
    ThreadsafeFace(loop, host, port). If the default Face(loop) constructor is
    used, if the forwarder's Unix socket file exists then connect using
    AsyncUnixTransport, otherwise connect to "localhost" on port 6363 using
    AsyncTcpTransport. You do not need to call processEvents since the
    asyncio loop does all processing. (Exception: If you pass a transport that
    is not an async transport like AsyncTcpTransport, then your application
    needs to call processEvents.)

    :param loop: The event loop, for example from asyncio.get_event_loop(). It
      is the responsibility of the application to start and stop the loop.
    :param Transport transport: An object of a subclass of Transport used for
      communication. If you do not want to call processEvents, then the
      transport should be an async transport like AsyncTcpTransport, in which
      case the transport should use the same loop.
    :param Transport.ConnectionInfo connectionInfo: An object of a subclass of
      Transport.ConnectionInfo to be used to connect to the transport.
    :param str host: In the Face(host, port) form of the constructor, host is
      the host of the NDN hub to connect using TcpTransport.
    :param int port: (optional) In the Face(host, port) form of the constructor,
      port is the port of the NDN hub. If omitted. use 6363.
